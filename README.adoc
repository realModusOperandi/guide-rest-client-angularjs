Explore how to access a simple RESTful web service and consume its resources with Angular in Open
Liberty.

// =================================================================================================
// Introduction
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to access a REST service and deserialize the returned JSON that contains a list of
artists and their albums by using an Angular service and the Angular HTTP Client.

The REST service that provides the artists and albums resource was written for you in advance and
responds with the [hotspot]`artists.json`. 

The Angular application has been created and configured for you in the `frontend` directory. It
contains the default starter page.

artists.json
[source, json, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/resources/artists.json[]
----

You will implement an Angular client that consumes this JSON and displays its contents at the
following URL: `\http://localhost:9080/app`.


To learn more about REST services and how you can write them, see
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service^].

// Starting the service
// =================================================================================================

== Starting the service

Before you begin the implementation, start the provided REST service so that the artist JSON is
available to you.

To start the REST service, run the Maven `install` and `liberty:start-server` goals from the `start`
directory:

[role='command']
----
mvn install liberty:start-server
----

After you start the server, you can find your artist JSON at the following URL: http://localhost:9080/artists[http://localhost:9080/artists^].


Any local changes to your JavaScript and HTML are picked up when you build the frontend. 
After you start the Open Liberty server, you do not need to restart it.

== Importing the HTTP client

Navigate to the start directory to begin. 

Your application will need some way of communicating with RESTful web services in order to retrieve their resources.
In the case of this guide, your application will need to communicate with the artists service to retrieve the artists JSON.
While there exists a variety of ways of doing this, you can use the included Angular HTTP Client module.

Begin by importing the Angular HTTP Client module into your application module. 

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `app.module.ts` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/app/app.module.ts`
----

app.module.ts
[source, javascript, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/app/app.module.ts[tags=**]
----

In Angular, a module declares all modules that it imports or exports. Angular applications
can have many modules; AppModule is the root module, and most apps import `HttpClientModule` here.

Import the [hotspot=3]`HttpClientModule` class and update the [hotspot=11-14]`imports` array within the 
[hotspot=7-17]`@NgModule` declaration to include [hotspot=13]`HttpClientModule`.

== Creating the Angular component

You will create the component in your application used to acquire and display data from the REST API. This file will contain
two classes: the service, which will handle data access, and the component itself, which will handle presenting the data.
The default Angular application already contains a component.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `app.component.ts` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/app/app.component.ts`
----

app.component.ts
[source, javascript, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/app/app.component.ts[tags=**]
----

First, import two classes you'll need for the service: [hotspot=2]`HttpClient` and [hotspot=3]`Injectable`. 

Next, define the [hotspot=5-20]`ArtistsService` class. You can do this in a separate file, or in the same file as the component. The class is annotated [hotspot=5]`@Injectable` so that instances of it can be provided to 
other classes which need to use it. 

The class injects an instance of the [hotspot=7]`HttpClient` class which it will use to request data 
from the REST API. It contains a constant [hotspot=9]`ARTISTS_URL` which points to the API endpoint it will
request data from. Finally, it implements a method [hotspot=11-18]`fetchArtists()` that makes the request
and returns the result.

To obtain the data for display on the page, `fetchArtists()` Tries to use the injected [hotspot=13]`http` instance to perform a `GET` HTTP request to the [hotspot=9]`ARTISTS_URL` and returning the result. If an error occurs,
it prints the message of the error to the console. 

[hotspot=11-18]`fetchArtists()` uses a feature of Javascript called [hotspot=11]`async` and [hotspot=13]`await` to make the request and receive the response
without preventing the application from working while it waits. In order to be compatible with this feature,
the result of the [hotspot=13]`HttpClient.get()` method must be converted to a Promise using `toPromise()`.

Finally, update the [hotspot=22-37]`AppComponent` class to use this service. 

Add a [hotspot=25]`providers` property to the [hotspot=22-27]`@Component` annotation to indicate that this component provides the [hotspot=5-18]`ArtistsService` to the rest of the application. 

Create a class member [hotspot=29]`artists` of type `any[]` and initialize it to an empty array. This will hold the artists retrieved from the service so the template can display them.

Inject an instance of the [hotspot=31]`ArtistsService` class into the constructor. In [hotspot=33-37]`ngOnInit`, the method called when a component is ready to be displayed, use the [hotspot=34]`artistsService` instance to request the artists data. Since [hotspot=11-18]`fetchArtists()` is an `async` function, it will return a Promise. To retrieve the data from the request, call [hotspot=34-36]`then()` on the promise and provide a function that will take in the data and store it to the `artists` class member.

== Creating the Angular component template

Now that you are fetching the data and storing it within your component, you will display the data in the browser.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the template of your component.#
`src/main/frontend/src/app/app.component.html`
----

app.component.html
[source, html, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/app/app.component.html[tags=html]
----

The Angular application is already set up to display the contents of this file. Replace the Angular
"Hello" HTML with a [hotspot=1]`div` that is repeated using `*ngFor` to iterate over all artists. The `artists` variable
is bound to the `artists` member of the component. Use the same strategy to iterate over each [hotspot=3]`album` for the
artist.

After everything is set up, point your browser to the web application root http://localhost:9080/app[http://localhost:9080/app^] to
see the following output:

[subs="quotes", role="no_copy"]
----
foo wrote 2 albums:
    Album titled *album_one* by *foo* contains *12* tracks
    Album tilted *album_two* by *foo* contains *15* tracks
bar wrote 1 albums:
    Album titled *foo walks into a bar* by *bar* contains *12* tracks
dj wrote 0 albums:
----


== Testing the AngularJS client

No explicit code directly uses the consumed artist JSON, so you do not need to write any test cases for this guide.

Whenever you change and build your Angular implementation, the application root at http://localhost:9080/app[http://localhost:9080/app^] will
reflect the changes automatically. You can visit the root to manually check whether the artist JSON
was consumed correctly. You can rebuild only your Angular frontend by running the following command:
[role='command']
```
mvn generate-resources
```

When you are done checking the application root, stop the Open Liberty server by running the following command:
[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Although this guide did not teach you how to build logic, you will likely build logic when you develop your own
applications, and testing will become a crucial part of your development lifecycle. If you need
to write test cases, follow the official unit testing and end-to-end testing documentation on the
https://angular.io/guide/testing[official Angular page^].
